### Contributing

Any help from UI / UX designers would be EXTREMELY appreciated. The challenge is to come up with new component designs / layouts that are broadly used in modern UIs, that weren't present back in 95.

If you want to help with the project, feel free to open pull requests and submit issues or component proposals. Let's bring this UI back to life ♥️
